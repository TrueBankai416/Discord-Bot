# Key Points:
# - SSL Configuration: Replace /path/to/your/fullchain.pem and /path/to/your/privkey.pem with the actual paths to your SSL certificate and private key files.
# - HSTS Configuration: The Strict-Transport-Security header is set to enable HSTS with a max age of 1 year, including subdomains, and allows for preloading.
# - Security Headers: Additional security headers are set to enhance the security of your Nextcloud instance.
# - Reverse Proxy: The ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse directives are used to forward requests to your Nextcloud instance running on localhost:8080.
# - Client IP Forwarding: The RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-For directive is used to forward the original client IP address to your Nextcloud instance.
